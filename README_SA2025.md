# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing Engine for Urban Parking Lots  
**Capstone Project | Summer Analytics 2025**  
_By Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati × Pathway_

---

## 🧠 Course Background

**Summer Analytics 2025** is a free, online 5‑week bootcamp (plus capstone week) designed for beginners aiming to build a strong foundation in data science and machine learning. It’s led by the Consulting & Analytics Club (C&A) at IIT Guwahati—known for reaching 25K+ students across 60+ countries and producing 300+ hours of content.

**Key highlights:**
- No prerequisites—just curiosity and a computer  
- Covers Python, data cleaning, visualization, ML (supervised + unsupervised), tree‑based models, neural networks, and real‑time data streaming  
- Industry‑relevant modules like Kafka and Pathway for streaming pipelines  
- Includes weekly tasks, webinars, mini‑hackathons, and a live capstone project with a hard deadline (July 9, 2025)

## 🧩 Capstone Project Overview

**Our project** tackles a real-world problem—dynamic pricing for urban parking lots—using models that:
- Start simple (baseline linear pricing)  
- Incorporate demand features  
- Finally integrate competitor data and real-time updates via Pathway  

This aligns perfectly with the capstone requirements and industry applications of the course.
